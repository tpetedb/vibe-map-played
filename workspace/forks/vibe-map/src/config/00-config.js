// Source configuration for the game: the numbers and colours a fork changes
// first. The build concatenates every file in src/config/ ahead of the game
// modules, so these names are in scope everywhere below. The journey level
// (name, difficulty, theme) arrives separately as CONFIG, injected from
// config/camp.toml; the theme presets themselves live in vibemap/themes.py.
// See docs/CONFIG.md.

// How large the island is around the walker. Meshes keep their size, so the
// world grows rather than the walker shrinking; speed, camera, fog and sky
// distances scale with it in their own modules so the feel stays the same.

// The island's radius in data units, before the scale.
const R=20;
// Each plot has an annex 6 to 8 data units outward, hidden until that stop is
// done. Its radius, scaled with the world.

// Tom's palette: the five hues the whole product uses, on OLED black. A fork
// that recolours the island starts here.
