// The camera. The fitted view is derived, not fixed: the distance that puts
// the whole island inside the frame comes from the island's radius and the
// field of view, so a narrow window pushes the camera back instead of cropping
// the island. pitch is the angle above the horizon in radians, follow is how
// much of the walker's position the fitted frame takes, drift caps how far
// that may pull the island off centre, ahead is the look-ahead along the walk
// and ease is how fast the frame catches up. glide is the seconds the camera
// takes from the title's orbit, or from a fast travel, down to the walker.
// far is the far plane in island units; the near plane follows the distance
// (nearK times it), which is what keeps ground decals from flickering when
// the camera is a long way out.
//
// zoom is one level from min to max. At -1 the camera is `near` units from
// the walker at nearPitch and frames the walker; at 0 it is the fitted view
// and frames the island; at 1 it is `far` times the fit at farPitch and
// frames the archipelago. start is where a fresh browser begins: close enough
// that the walker and the companion read on a phone. step is one press of a
// key or a button, wheel is levels per wheel pixel, pinch is how much stronger
// a trackpad pinch is than the wheel it arrives as, ease is per second.

// The pixel companion that follows the walker (src/game/19b-pet.js). The

// a number here. FOLLOW and LAG are what make it a companion rather than a
// shadow: it settles that far behind the walker, and reaches the spot with an
// exponential ease of that rate per second. SIDE keeps it off to the walker's
// right, because straight behind is straight under his nameplate from this
// camera and the companion would spend the walk hidden by his back. PX is
// world units per sprite pixel, so the packs keep their sizes against each
// other and against a walker about 2.6 units tall: a duck of sixteen pixels
// stands 1.6 high, a turtle of eight stands 0.8. On screen a sprite pixel is
// always a whole number of device pixels and never fewer than MIN_TEXEL, so
// the art stays crisp at every zoom. LEASH
// is how far it may fall behind before it stops going round and comes
// straight to the walker. CHEER is the seconds it celebrates a claimed stop,
// NIGHT how far the sprite is tinted towards the moonlight at the last stage.
