"""Themes: the same course in a different voice.

The wine-night preset is the original: corporate jargon on top of real
content, Rolinda speaking plainly. The serious presets keep the content and
change the framing, the pairing and the hosts. A custom theme is a TOML file
in themes/ with the same fields; `vibe theme create` asks the provider to
write one.
