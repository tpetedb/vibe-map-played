# AGENTS.md

Instructions for any AI coding agent working in this repository. Format: https://agents.md (plain Markdown, no required fields). Claude Code reads this through `CLAUDE.md`.

## Project overview

A gamified course and a template: a single-file 3D browser game (`game/grimoire.html`), a terminal companion with quests and XP (`grimoire/`), a small data pipeline (`data/`, `sql/`, `python/`), and an Obsidian vault (`vault/`) that grows as the learner progresses. Keep it small and readable. One file per concern; a dependency only when it removes real work.

## File map

| Path | Owns |
|---|---|
| `game/grimoire.html` | The built game, one file, three.js embedded, no CDN. Produced by `just build` from `src/`; never hand-edit once `src/` exists. |
| `src/` | The game's source parts in load order; `tools/build.py` concatenates them. `src/data/campaign.json` is the one source for the four evenings and twelve mentors (the game and the CLI both read it). `src/vendor/three.min.js` is three.js r128, never edited. |
| `game/index.html` | Lotte's own game from workstream 1. Nothing may depend on its contents. |
| `grimoire/` | The CLI package: `cli.py` (click commands), `state.py` (pydantic models, versioned), `quests.py` (auto-verified workstreams and XP), `vault.py` (Obsidian writer and lint), `scores.py` (polars and DuckDB), `tui.py` (the `just start` onboarding), `personas.py` and `themes.py` (presets), `config.py` (`grimoire.toml`). |
| `tools/tech.py` | The one source of truth for the tech tree. `tools/regen_tree.py` emits the vault notes, the tree JS and `docs/ROADMAP.md`. |
| `tests/` | The pytest battery: CLI and quest unit tests, build check, Playwright smoke tests in Chromium and WebKit. |
| `data/scores.csv` | The system of record for scores. Columns `played_at,player,score,duration_s`; never rename without changing `sql/` and `python/`. |
| `docs/` | `SYLLABUS.md` (the course), `ROADMAP.md` (generated), `RESOURCES.md` (curated links), `AOE-STUDY.md` (what sokrypton/aoe taught us). |
| `vault/` | The Obsidian vault. `vault/Grimoire/Tonight.md` is the hot cache; every note is reachable from it. `.obsidian/` is pre-configured. |
| `.agents/skills/` | Skills in the Agent Skills standard. `.claude/skills/` holds symlinks to them. |
| `justfile`, `agents.just` | Every task a human or an agent runs. `just` lists them; `just start` onboards. |

## Ways of working

- Say what you are about to do before you touch more than one file. Restate the request in one line and name the files.
- The game stays one file with no CDN and three.js embedded. Edit `src/`, run `just build`, test the built file.
- State is data, the view is derived. Everything persisted lives in the game's `S` object or the CLI's `state.json`; the DOM, the 3D scene and the vault notes are rebuilt from it, never the other way round.
- One helper per concept (`mat()`, `fixColors()`, `onLandW()`, `Vault.write()`). Never re-spell the raw check at a call site.
- Comments state constraints and why, in one or two lines. Never narrate changes ("replaced the old X"), never date a comment, never reference line numbers in other files.
- Versioned formats fail loudly. The progress code and `state.json` carry a version; an unknown version is refused with a clear message, not patched around.
- Scores are a system of record. Never reset or rewrite `data/scores.csv` without asking.
- Python dependencies are welcome when they remove real work. Declare them in `pyproject.toml`, install with `uv`, never bare pip.
- After every change, end with one line: what changed.

## Test loop

Adopted from sokrypton/aoe, see `docs/AOE-STUDY.md`:

1. While iterating, run the test closest to the blast radius: `just test-one "tests/test_cli.py"` or `just smoke`.
2. Before every commit, the full battery: `just verify` (ruff, pytest with Playwright, build check). Zero page errors in the browser is the bar.
3. Test the entry point, not the mechanism. The smoke test clicks the real buttons; it does not call `claim()` directly.
4. Take a screenshot and look at it. They land in `tests/out/`.
5. Regenerate, never hand-edit: `just tree` after editing `tools/tech.py`.

## Commands

- `just` lists everything. `just start` is the onboarding menu. `just setup` installs what is missing.
- Run the game: `just game`. Build it: `just build`.
- Progress and quests: `uv run grimoire status`, `uv run grimoire check`, `uv run grimoire done <n>`.
- Scores: `uv run grimoire scores`, `duckdb -c "$(cat sql/top_runs.sql)"`, `python3 python/scores.py`.
- Tests: `just test`. Full gate: `just verify`.

## Code style

- Python: `from __future__ import annotations`, frozen dataclasses or pydantic models, a `__main__` guard, `ruff format` at line length 88, `basedpyright` basic.
- SQL: lowercase keywords, one clause per line, a comment above the query explaining the question it answers.
- HTML/JS: no build step beyond concatenation, no minification of our own code, comments where the logic is not obvious.
- Copy: no em-dashes anywhere. Rolinda speaks plainly; everyone else speaks corporate. Ask before changing tone.

## Notes and memory

- The Obsidian vault is `vault/`. One note per topic in `vault/Grimoire/`. Frontmatter with `title`, `date` and `tags`. Link generously with `[[wikilinks]]`. Date entries newest first.
- After a session, write or update the note for what was built and link it from `vault/Grimoire/Tonight.md`. `uv run grimoire vault lint` finds orphans and dead links.

## Git

- Commit after every change you would be sad to lose. Message: what and why, one line.
- Never force-push. Never rewrite history on `main`. Push feature branches and open a draft PR; Tom merges.

## Security

- No secrets in the repo. Tokens go in `.env` (gitignored, see `.env.example`) or the OS keychain.
- Do not run commands that delete outside this folder.
