"Unix and the terminal":{t:"dark",md:`# Unix and the terminal
The terminal is a text conversation with the computer. Every tool in this tree is a command you type; every agent in the Imperial Age is, underneath, typing those same commands for you. Learning ten commands (ls, cd, cat, mkdir, cp, mv, rm, grep, find, man) covers most of daily use.
**History.** Unix was born at Bell Labs in 1969 (Thompson, Ritchie). macOS is a certified Unix, so your Mac terminal is the direct descendant. Linux (1991, Torvalds) is the free reimplementation that servers, clouds and containers run on.
**Try in five minutes.** Open Terminal.app. Type pwd, then ls -la, then man ls (q to quit).

"Bash and shell scripts":{t:"dark",md:`# Bash and shell scripts
Bash is the language the terminal speaks. A shell script is a text file of commands; pipes (|) chain small tools into big ones. This is also what hooks and setup scripts are written in.
**History.** The Bourne shell shipped with Seventh Edition Unix in January 1979; bash (the Bourne-again shell, written by Brian Fox) went into beta as the GNU replacement in June 1989. macOS switched its default login shell to zsh with macOS 10.15 Catalina in 2019; zsh is bash-compatible for everything you will meet tonight.

~/.zshrc runs every time you open a terminal: it sets PATH (the folders where commands are looked up), aliases (short names for long commands), the prompt, and small functions. zsh is the macOS default; it is bash-compatible for daily use and adds better completion and globbing. oh-my-zsh bundles plugins and themes; starship is a fast prompt that works in any shell. Keep .zshrc in your dotfiles repo so a new machine is one clone away.

A project is a folder. A path is an address inside it: absolute (/Users/lotte/grimoire) or relative (./data/scores.csv). Agents work inside one folder at a time and see the world as files, which is why structure matters more than in a GUI.
**History.** The hierarchical file system with directories comes from Multics (Daley and Neumann, 1965) via Unix. Hidden dotfiles are, according to Rob Pike, the result of an early Unix shortcut: ls skipped every name starting with a dot to hide . and .., and people started using it on purpose.

".env files and secrets":{t:"dark",md:`# .env files and secrets
A .env file holds KEY=VALUE pairs (API tokens, database URLs) that your code reads at startup, so the secret lives on the machine and not in the repo. The pattern: .env is listed in .gitignore and never committed; .env.example (in this repo env.example, without the dot, because some agent guardrails refuse anything that looks like a real .env) is committed with the same keys and empty values so the next person knows what to fill in; python-dotenv loads .env into os.environ. A token that lands in a commit has to be rotated, because git history is forever.
**History.** The twelve-factor app (Adam Wiggins at Heroku, 2011) made 'store config in the environment' a rule. The dotenv convention started with Brandon Keepers' Ruby dotenv gem in July 2012; python-dotenv followed on PyPI in September 2014.

**History.** SOAP was designed from 1998 and published in 1999; REST-with-JSON replaced it in the 2010s; GraphQL (open sourced 2015) and gRPC (announced 2015, 1.0 in 2016) added alternatives. Today the agent-facing version of an API is an MCP server.

"YAML in practice: CI and Compose":{t:"castle",md:`# YAML in practice: CI and Compose
YAML is data shaped by indentation: a map is key: value, a list is lines starting with a dash, nesting is two spaces. Strings rarely need quotes, which is the trap: no, yes, on and 3:30 can turn into booleans or numbers unless you quote them. One file can hold several documents separated by ---, so a stray separator silently splits your config. CI (GitHub Actions) and Docker Compose chose it because a pipeline is a nested list of steps that people read and diff more often than machines do.
**History.** YAML began in 2001 and the 1.0 spec was published in 2004 by Clark Evans, Oren Ben-Kiki and Ingy dot Net; the 1.2.2 revision (October 2021) clarified the spec without changing it. GitHub Actions became generally available in November 2019 with YAML workflows.

A CHANGELOG.md lists what changed for the person using your thing: newest first, one section per version with its date, six kinds of change (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security) and an Unreleased section on top. It is not the git log. Commits are for the people who wrote them; the changelog is for everyone else.
**History.** Olivier Lacan started Keep a Changelog on 31 May 2014 as a CHANGELOG that documents itself, under the motto 'Don't let your friends dump git logs into changelogs.' Version 1.0.0 followed on 20 June 2017, 1.1.0 on 15 February 2019 and 2.0.0 on 7 June 2026. The site is MIT licensed; this repo follows 1.1.0.
**Try in five minutes.** cat CHANGELOG.md. Then make one change to the repo and add its line under Unreleased in the same commit.

"Architecture decision records":{t:"imperial",md:`# Architecture decision records
An ADR is one short file per decision: Title, Status, Context (the forces), Decision (we will ...), Consequences (all of them). Numbered, never deleted, superseded instead. It is the memory an agent cannot infer from the code: why the repo is MIT, why the game is one file, why XP is verified. AGENTS.md says what the rules are; docs/adr/ says why.
**History.** Michael Nygard published Documenting Architecture Decisions on 15 November 2011: a page per decision, kept in the repo with the code, in a form borrowed from Alexandrian patterns. The GitHub adr organisation (adr.github.io) collects the templates and tools that followed; MADR, the Markdown variant with drivers and options, reached 4.0.0 in September 2024.
**Try in five minutes.** ls docs/adr, then cat docs/adr/0004-quests-verify-real-work.md. Write ADR 0005 with the adr skill for the next thing you decide.

"README and the quickstart":{t:"feudal",md:`# README and the quickstart
The README is the front page: what this is, for whom, and the commands that get a stranger from clone to a working run, on the first screen. GitHub shows it under the file list, agents read it first, and it is the last thing maintainers update, which is why every command in it must be one you just ran.
**History.** The name is older than most of this tree. Seventh Edition Unix (1979) shipped /usr/doc/README, a few lines telling you how to format the manual's papers, and DECUS library tapes for the PDP-10 carried READ.ME files of 'random notes' for whoever installed the software. Markdown and GitHub turned README.md into the page a repository opens on; makeareadme.com is the modern checklist.
**Try in five minutes.** head -30 README.md, then run the first Quickstart command exactly as written. If it fails, fix the README, not the reader.

"Tech tree":{t:"future",md:`# Tech tree
The roadmap from intern to expert, Age of Empires style. Each age has a level; each technology says what it is, real history, a five-minute try, docs, and what it unlocks.
**Dark Age (Intern).** The terminal and files. Everything else is built on this; nobody skips it, everybody wishes they had learned it earlier. [[Unix and the terminal]], [[Bash and shell scripts]], [[zsh and your shell config]], [[Files, folders and paths]], [[Dotfiles]], [[Config formats: JSON, YAML, TOML, Markdown]], [[.env files and secrets]], [[localhost and ports]], [[Git]]
**Feudal Age (Junior).** Languages and data. You can now make the machine do a specific thing and keep the result. [[Python]], [[TOML in practice: pyproject.toml]], [[Python libraries: what they are for]], [[SQL and DuckDB]], [[HTML, CSS and JavaScript]], [[Other languages and what they are for]], [[Markdown and Obsidian]], [[Data: files, schemas, warehouses]], [[README and the quickstart]]
**Castle Age (Medior).** Networks and shipping. Your thing runs somewhere other than your laptop, repeatably. [[HTTP and APIs]], [[Building and consuming APIs]], [[SSH and remote machines]], [[YAML in practice: CI and Compose]], [[Docker and containers]], [[GitHub, pull requests, Pages]], [[CI/CD and automation]], [[Cloud and servers]], [[Semantic Versioning]], [[Changelogs (Keep a Changelog)]]
**Imperial Age (Senior).** The AI harness. You stop typing code and start directing agents, with guardrails you wrote. [[LLM versus harness]], [[Context window and prompts]], [[Your harness: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, dotfiles for agents]], [[AGENTS.md]], [[Agent Skills standard]], [[Hook]], [[MCP]], [[Subagents and multi-agent]], [[Headless agents and scheduling]], [[Tests and evals]], [[Security and permissions]], [[Cost, tokens and model choice]], [[Architecture decision records]]
**Future Age (Expert).** What is coming, what stays the same, and what a knowledge worker or founder should actually do about it. [[Kubernetes and platforms]], [[Claude and Obsidian]], [[The future perspective]]
