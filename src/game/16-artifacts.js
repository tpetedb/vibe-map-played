// Artifacts: props on the island that explain one idea each when you walk up
// and press Inspect. The list, the copy and Rolinda's question come from
// campaign.json (ARTIFACTS); the button demos live here because they are
// presentation. Found artifacts persist in S.artifacts and travel in the
// progress code, so the CLI can note them and hand out the collector badge.
