# Media

Every image in this folder, what it shows, what renders it and where it is used. A picture nobody links to is either a job for a document or a job for the bin; this table is how that stays true.

Regenerate with `just media` (the game, through Playwright, from the built file), `uv run python tools/campus_shots.py` (the campus before anyone has played) and `just tui-media` (the terminal screens and the pets, from real terminal output). All three write here. Never hand-edit an image in place; render it again. One test writes here too, which it should not: `tests/test_game_pet.py` rewrites the six `pets-game/` crops while [issue 148](https://github.com/tpetedb/vibe-map/issues/148) is open, and `just media` is what puts them back. Every other test writes to `tests/out/`.
