# Architecture decision records

One file per decision, in Michael Nygard's form (Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences), numbered in order and never renumbered. Write the next one with the `adr` skill (`.agents/skills/adr/SKILL.md`). A reversed decision is not deleted: a new record supersedes it and links back. `AGENTS.md` says what the rules are; this folder says why.

| ADR | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
