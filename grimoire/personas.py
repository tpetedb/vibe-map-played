"""Personas: the same course, tuned to the learner's field of work.

A persona changes the example game, the sample dataset, Rolinda's question
and the recipes. It never changes the workstreams themselves: every persona
still ships a game, writes AGENTS.md, queries a CSV, learns git, connects a
tool, links a vault, publishes, and schedules an agent.
