## Get Current
- [ ] Review action lists: mark off done, record further steps
- [ ] Review the past calendar for leftover actions and reference
- [ ] Review the upcoming calendar and capture what it triggers
- [ ] Review the waiting-for list: chase, or check off what arrived
- [ ] Review projects: at least one current action on each
- [ ] Review any relevant checklists

## Get Creative
- [ ] Review someday/maybe: promote what is now active, delete the rest
- [ ] Be creative and courageous: add one bold idea to the system

## Covered
- [[ ]] to [[ ]] (daily notes)

_DAILY_HUB = """The lowest-friction start: Obsidian opens or creates today's note, a
template gives it a shape, and once a week David Allen's checklist gets you
clear, current and creative. The daily note captures; the weekly review keeps
it from rotting. Notes go in `Methods/Daily notes and weekly review/`; the
templates are in `_templates/daily-weekly/`.

## Folders
- `Daily/`: one note per day, named YYYY-MM-DD by the plugin
- `Weekly/`: one review per week

## Daily loop
1. Open today's note: the calendar icon in the ribbon, or the "Open today's
   daily note" command. In Settings, Core plugins, Daily notes, point the
   template at `_templates/daily-weekly/Daily.md` and the new file location
   at this method's `Daily/` folder.
2. Log as you go: what happened, what you decided, what you learned, one
   line each; tasks as `- [ ]`.
3. Before you close the laptop, tick what is done and move the rest to
   tomorrow or to the project it belongs to.
4. On Friday, insert the Weekly review template in `Weekly/` and walk it top
   to bottom: Get Clear, Get Current, Get Creative.
5. Link the review to the daily notes it covered and to what it changed.

## Worked example

```markdown
# 2026-09-16

## Log
- 18:00 Innovation Hub: the game ships in one file; double-click works
- decided: keep the scores.csv columns as they are, sql/ depends on them

## Tasks
- [x] run the vault lint
- [ ] write the Cornell note for Evening 2

## Learned
- the Templates plugin takes Moment.js tokens after a colon: {{date:dddd}}

## Review (Fridays)
Run [[Weekly review 2026-W38]] top to bottom:
- [ ] Get Clear · [ ] Get Current · [ ] Get Creative
