"""The council of mentors: the llm-council pattern with the twelve mentors.

Three stages, the way karpathy/llm-council does it with several models:
each mentor answers the question in character, grounded in the ideas and
sources recorded for them in campaign.json; each mentor then reviews the
other answers anonymised; a chairman synthesises the ranking into minutes.
Every stage is one call to the configured provider CLI in print mode, so it
works with any of them and costs a handful of calls.
