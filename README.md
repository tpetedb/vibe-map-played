# Vibe Code Camp, played

This repository is [tpetedb/vibe-map](https://github.com/tpetedb/vibe-map) after a full campaign: four islands, thirty-two stops, every mentor met, all ten artifacts inspected, the finale reached, played as Tom (data engineer, hard). The state (`.vibe/state.json`), the config (`vibe.toml`) and the vault the CLI built from it are committed, so you can see what an evening leaves behind before you start your own. Open `vault/` in Obsidian for the graph (the R2-D2 theme is installed; pick it under Appearance) and the 35 Obsidian feature notes with their canvas, base and deck; `uv run vibe status` for the grid; `uv run vibe pet` for the creature the name rolled. The template's own README follows.

# Vibe Code Camp

From intern to expert in one evening, with wine. A 3D island you walk across, eight workstreams that each leave something real on your machine, a terminal companion that checks your work and awards XP, and an Obsidian vault that grows as you go. .

![The Innovation Campus at dusk, five of eight OKRs lit](docs/media/island-campus.png)

## Play now, nothing to install

Download or clone, then double-click `game/vibe-map.html`. One file, three.js embedded, no CDN, works offline on a Mac, a phone or a locked-down laptop. It is also served at https://tpetedb.github.io/vibe-map/ once GitHub Pages is switched on.

![Walking to the 18:00 signpost, opening the workstream, unlocking the OKR](docs/media/gameplay.gif)

## The whole thing, in three commands

Step by step, with what you should see after each command: [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

```bash
brew install just
just setup     # Homebrew tools, uv and the Python env, Playwright browsers, skills, the vault
just start     # the onboarding screen: who you are, what the machine has, where to go
```

![just start: name, field, difficulty, provider and theme, in the house palette](docs/media/tui-welcome.png)

`just start` asks for your name, your field, a difficulty from beginner to god, your model provider (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot or OpenCode) and a theme, checks the toolbelt with one-key installs (or a YOLO button that installs everything), and launches the game, Claude Code, Claude in YOLO mode, Zed with Claude over ACP, the vault in Obsidian or the tests.

The game onboards on its own too. A first visit asks who you are (Lotte, Frank, Max, Rolinda or your own name), how hard, and whether you want just the game or the full experience; the last one prints the exact terminal commands with your name and today's date filled in, folder convention included: `vibe-map-<name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>`.

![The title screen on a first visit: character, difficulty, how to play](docs/media/onboarding-start.png)

The three windows, one loop, over weeks: [docs/LONG-GAME.md](docs/LONG-GAME.md) spells it out command by command.

## Or install the CLI once, anywhere

```bash
uv tool install vibe-map          # `vibe` on your PATH, no clone needed
vibe new                          # a fresh camp: vibe-map-<you>-<today>
vibe new ~/camp --github you/camp # a named folder, as a new GitHub repo
cd vibe-map-* && vibe status      # the CLI finds the camp from any subfolder
```

`vibe` carries the campaign, the tech tree and the resources inside the package. `VIBE_HOME` points it at a camp from elsewhere.

## What one evening leaves behind

![The campaign map in the onboarding terminal: four islands, eight stops each](docs/media/tui-map.png)

| Time  | Workstream            | You end up with                                      | The check |
|-------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 18:00 | Innovation Hub        | a playable single-file game                          | `game/index.html` is no longer the placeholder |
| 19:00 | Centre of Excellence  | AGENTS.md rules and a first skill                    | eight lines of rules, one valid SKILL.md |
| 20:00 | Data Warehouse        | scores.csv, DuckDB queries, a Python chart           | rows in the CSV, a query, a script |
| 21:00 | Business Continuity   | git history, a rollback, one hook                    | three commits and a hooks block |
| 21:30 | Stakeholder Bridge    | one MCP integration                                  | a server in `.mcp.json` |
| 22:00 | Knowledge Tree        | a linked vault and its graph                         | six notes, twelve links, no dead ones |
| 22:30 | Go-to-Market          | the game at a public URL                             | a Pages workflow or a live Pages site |
| 23:00 | Autonomous Operations | headless Claude on a schedule, a subagent            | a subagent file and a schedule |

`uv run vibe check 3` runs the checks for a workstream and awards the XP when they pass. Levels are the XP ladder: Intern, Junior, Medior, Senior, Expert. Four evenings, four islands, thirty-two stops, twelve mentors from the field who stand on the islands with their real ideas and sources.

## Twenty things on the islands that explain one idea each

![The cafe artifact: order a coffee, get a 200; order five, get a 429](docs/media/artifact-cafe.png)

Walk up to a yellow ring and press **Inspect**. On the campus, the cafe serves a coffee the way a server answers a client (200, 404, 429, 503, with the latency); the fountain is a cache (miss, hit, stale, invalidate); the well is a database (a scan, an index, a transaction); the lighthouse is DNS; the dock packs, ships and unloads a container; the windmill is cron; the balloon is the cloud with its meter running; the mountain is the stack, six layers from the chip to the agent; the market stall is an API with a menu; the bridge is MCP. Each one prints its demo like a terminal, ends with a question from Rolinda, and links the vault note that goes deeper. Found ones turn green, travel in the progress code, and earn the Collector badge.

![The winter island with the data centre, the library and the energy grid](docs/media/island-winter-artifacts.png)

The second wave is spread over the four islands, and each one is a small building the walker has to go round. Campus: the factory (a data pipeline, raw to bronze to silver to gold, a failed run that reruns cleanly) and the post office (queues and pub/sub, a subscriber that was offline, at-least-once delivery, the dead-letter shelf). Sandbox: the shop (a package registry, `uv add` as buying, `uv.lock` as the receipt, a yanked version) and the bank (secrets and auth, a token is a key, `.env` is the safe, a leaked key revoked and rotated). Cold storage: the data centre (where the model runs, an inference request's path, latency by region, a cold start, batch versus interactive), the energy grid (tokens as watts, a rate limit as a fuse, autoscaling, a budget alarm) and the library (RAG, a question becomes a vector, the nearest shelves, a citation, a stale index). Production: the office (a team of agents, planner, worker and reviewer, `AGENTS.md` as the handbook, a review gate that rejects, subagents as departments), the households (users and privacy, data minimisation, anonymisation, a GDPR request answered) and the school (training a model, train and test split, overfitting caught by the test, a benchmark score).

## Make it yours

- **Persona.** `uv run vibe persona data-engineer` tunes the example game, the dataset, Rolinda's questions and the recipes to your field. Six presets: chief of staff, cleaning-company CEO, university managing director, pabo teacher, data engineer, interior stylist.
- **Difficulty.** `uv run vibe difficulty hard`: beginner and easy spell every command out, hard and expert add strict and extra checks, god needs `just verify` green to claim.
- **Theme.** `uv run vibe theme boardroom` swaps the wine-night jargon for a serious voice; `--create` asks your provider to write a new one into `themes/`.
- **Provider.** Everything that talks to a model (`explain`, `council`, custom themes) uses the CLI you chose, in print mode.
- **Obsidian, feature by feature.** `uv run vibe vault feature --all` writes one note per Obsidian feature (links, properties, callouts, canvas, bases, templates, daily notes, bookmarks, search, hotkeys, workspaces, slides, URI, CLI, Sync, Publish and more) with the exact commands and a five-minute try from the official help, plus working example files: a canvas, a base, a template, a deck, a CSS snippet. The table: [docs/OBSIDIAN.md](docs/OBSIDIAN.md).
- **Settings, in the game.** The Settings button on the HUD: map size (compact, big, the whole window), full screen, vault mode, pairings on or off, shadows, motion, walking speed. They apply at once and stay in the browser.
- **News.** `just news` (or `uv run vibe news` then `just build`) pulls six AI feeds (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Simon Willison, Claude Code releases, the GitHub changelog, arXiv cs.AI; change them under `[news]` in `vibe.toml`) into `data/news.json` and the vault note News; the Roadmap shows the latest items; a weekly GitHub Action keeps a forked repo and its hosted game current.
- **Grow mode.** `uv run vibe vault mode grow` empties the vault down to its hubs and keeps every note in `vault/_library` (hidden from Obsidian's graph and search). Notes come back as you play: a workstream's notes when its stop is done, an artifact's notes when you inspect it, a mentor when you go deep, the Obsidian feature notes when the vault stop is done, or any note by hand with `vibe vault unlock`. The in-game vault follows the same rules, so you watch the graph grow. `vibe vault mode full` brings everything back.
- **Note-taking.** `uv run vibe vault method zettelkasten` bootstraps a method into the vault: Zettelkasten, PARA, Johnny.Decimal, LYT, Evergreen, Cornell, Bullet Journal, or daily notes with a weekly review.

Every knob lives in `vibe.toml`; delete the file and everything still works.

## A pet in the terminal

![The launch screen of just start with the pet strolling under the status line](docs/media/tui-pet.gif)

```bash
uv run vibe pet                       # the creature your name rolled, with its stats
uv run vibe pet --animate             # it fidgets and blinks until Ctrl-C
uv run vibe pet --species crab --name Pinch --hat crown
uv run vibe pet --all                 # the gallery: nineteen species
```

It also strolls across the launch screen of `just start` and sits next to `vibe status`. Same name, same creature: the roll is the one from claude-buddy, so a name that hatched a snail in Claude Code hatches the same snail here. Everything is overridable in `vibe.toml` under `[pet]`, or switch it off with `--off`.

## Your terminal, Tom's way

```bash
uv run vibe dotfiles                       # six modules and whether they are in place
uv run vibe dotfiles show zsh              # the files, the brew line, what to do after
uv run vibe dotfiles install zsh --brew    # completion dropdown, fzf, highlighting, one line in ~/.zshrc
uv run vibe dotfiles install --all         # tmux bar, Ghostty theme, Starship prompt, AeroSpace, the R2-D2 Obsidian theme
```

Adapted from [Tom's toolbox](https://github.com/tpetedb/toms-toolbox) (MIT). Anything that already exists and differs is backed up next to itself first. The same screen lives in `just start` under Terminal setup.

## Break things on purpose

```bash
just break sandbox          # a play/sandbox branch, a sandbox
uv run vibe explain     # your provider explains the last commits in plain words
just rescue                 # back on main, nothing lost
uv run vibe council "Should I learn git before Python?"   # four mentors answer, review each other, a chairman decides
```

## Use it as a template

Press **Use this template** on GitHub, clone, `just setup`, `just start`. To see what a finished campaign looks like, open [vibe-map-played](https://github.com/tpetedb/vibe-map-played): the same template after every island, stop and mentor was played, with its state, vault and progress code committed. The repo practises what it teaches: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in Keep a Changelog form, decisions in `docs/adr/`, versions in `pyproject.toml`, CI and Pages as GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/`, secrets in a gitignored `.env` next to `env.example`.

## For agents

Read [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md), then [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). `just verify` is the gate before a commit.

## Credits and licences

MIT. three.js (MIT), [Motion](https://motion.dev) (MIT), [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force) (ISC, the vault graph) and [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons (ISC) are embedded in the game. The terminal pet's sprites, idle animation and name roll are ported from [claude-buddy](https://github.com/btcromesh/claude-buddy) by Romesh Niriella (MIT), itself extracted from the /buddy feature Claude Code shipped for a week in April 2026; the crab is ours. Two vendored skills keep their licences next to them (Anthropic's webapp-testing, Apache-2.0; obra's verification-before-completion, MIT). The idea for the tech tree is Age of Empires; the study of a real browser AoE, sokrypton/aoe, is in the docs, ideas only.
