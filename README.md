# Vibe Code Camp, played

This repository is [tpetedb/vibe-map](https://github.com/tpetedb/vibe-map) after a full campaign: four islands, thirty-two stops, every mentor met, the finale reached, played as Tom (data engineer, hard). The state (`.vibe/state.json`), the config (`vibe.toml`) and the vault the CLI built from it are committed, so you can see what an evening leaves behind before you start your own. Open `vault/` in Obsidian for the graph; `uv run vibe status` for the grid; `uv run vibe pet` for the creature the name rolled. The template's own README follows.

# Vibe Code Camp

From intern to expert in one evening, with wine. A 3D island you walk across, eight workstreams that each leave something real on your machine, a terminal companion that checks your work and awards XP, and an Obsidian vault that grows as you go. .

## Play now, nothing to install

Download or clone, then double-click `game/vibe-map.html`. One file, three.js embedded, no CDN, works offline on a Mac, a phone or a locked-down laptop. It is also served at https://tpetedb.github.io/vibe-map/ once GitHub Pages is switched on.

![Walking to the 18:00 signpost, opening the workstream, unlocking the OKR](docs/media/gameplay.gif)

## The whole thing, in three commands

Step by step, with what you should see after each command: [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

```bash
brew install just
just setup     # Homebrew tools, uv and the Python env, Playwright browsers, skills, the vault
just start     # the onboarding screen: who you are, what the machine has, where to go
```

![just start: name, field, difficulty, provider and theme, in the house palette](docs/media/tui-welcome.png)

`just start` asks for your name, your field, a difficulty from beginner to god, your model provider (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot or OpenCode) and a theme, checks the toolbelt with one-key installs (or a YOLO button that installs everything), and launches the game, Claude Code, Claude in YOLO mode, Zed with Claude over ACP, the vault in Obsidian or the tests.

## Or install the CLI once, anywhere

```bash
uv tool install vibe-map          # `vibe` on your PATH, no clone needed
vibe new ~/camp                   # a fresh camp from the template
vibe new ~/camp --github you/camp # the same, as a new GitHub repo
cd ~/camp && vibe status          # the CLI finds the camp from any subfolder
```

`vibe` carries the campaign, the tech tree and the resources inside the package. `VIBE_HOME` points it at a camp from elsewhere.

## What one evening leaves behind

![The campaign map in the onboarding terminal: four islands, eight stops each](docs/media/tui-map.png)

| Time  | Workstream            | You end up with                                      | The check |
|-------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 18:00 | Innovation Hub        | a playable single-file game                          | `game/index.html` is no longer the placeholder |
| 19:00 | Centre of Excellence  | AGENTS.md rules and a first skill                    | eight lines of rules, one valid SKILL.md |
| 20:00 | Data Warehouse        | scores.csv, DuckDB queries, a Python chart           | rows in the CSV, a query, a script |
| 21:00 | Business Continuity   | git history, a rollback, one hook                    | three commits and a hooks block |
| 21:30 | Stakeholder Bridge    | one MCP integration                                  | a server in `.mcp.json` |
| 22:00 | Knowledge Tree        | a linked vault and its graph                         | six notes, twelve links, no dead ones |
| 22:30 | Go-to-Market          | the game at a public URL                             | a Pages workflow or a live Pages site |
| 23:00 | Autonomous Operations | headless Claude on a schedule, a subagent            | a subagent file and a schedule |

`uv run vibe check 3` runs the checks for a workstream and awards the XP when they pass. Levels mirror the ages of the tech tree: Intern, Junior, Medior, Senior, Expert. Four evenings, four islands, thirty-two stops, twelve mentors from the field who stand on the islands with their real ideas and sources.

## Make it yours

- **Persona.** `uv run vibe persona data-engineer` tunes the example game, the dataset, Rolinda's questions and the recipes to your field. Six presets: chief of staff, cleaning-company CEO, university managing director, pabo teacher, data engineer, interior stylist.
- **Difficulty.** `uv run vibe difficulty hard`: beginner and easy spell every command out, hard and expert add strict and extra checks, god needs `just verify` green to claim.
- **Theme.** `uv run vibe theme boardroom` swaps the wine-night jargon for a serious voice; `--create` asks your provider to write a new one into `themes/`.
- **Provider.** Everything that talks to a model (`explain`, `council`, custom themes) uses the CLI you chose, in print mode.
- **Note-taking.** `uv run vibe vault method zettelkasten` bootstraps a method into the vault: Zettelkasten, PARA, Johnny.Decimal, LYT, Evergreen, Cornell, Bullet Journal, or daily notes with a weekly review.

Every knob lives in `vibe.toml`; delete the file and everything still works.

## A pet in the terminal

![The launch screen of just start with the pet strolling under the status line](docs/media/tui-pet.gif)

```bash
uv run vibe pet                       # the creature your name rolled, with its stats
uv run vibe pet --animate             # it fidgets and blinks until Ctrl-C
uv run vibe pet --species crab --name Pinch --hat crown
uv run vibe pet --all                 # the gallery: nineteen species
```

It also strolls across the launch screen of `just start` and sits next to `vibe status`. Same name, same creature: the roll is the one from claude-buddy, so a name that hatched a snail in Claude Code hatches the same snail here. Everything is overridable in `vibe.toml` under `[pet]`, or switch it off with `--off`.

## Break things on purpose

```bash
just break sandbox          # a play/sandbox branch, a sandbox
uv run vibe explain     # your provider explains the last commits in plain words
just rescue                 # back on main, nothing lost
uv run vibe council "Should I learn git before Python?"   # four mentors answer, review each other, a chairman decides
```

## Use it as a template

Press **Use this template** on GitHub, clone, `just setup`, `just start`. To see what a finished campaign looks like, open [vibe-map-played](https://github.com/tpetedb/vibe-map-played): the same template after every island, stop and mentor was played, with its state, vault and progress code committed. The repo practises what it teaches: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in Keep a Changelog form, decisions in `docs/adr/`, versions in `pyproject.toml`, CI and Pages as GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/`, secrets in a gitignored `.env` next to `env.example`.

## For agents

Read [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md), then [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). `just verify` is the gate before a commit.

## Credits and licences

MIT. three.js (MIT), [Motion](https://motion.dev) (MIT), [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force) (ISC, the vault graph) and [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons (ISC) are embedded in the game. The terminal pet's sprites, idle animation and name roll are ported from [claude-buddy](https://github.com/btcromesh/claude-buddy) by Romesh Niriella (MIT), itself extracted from the /buddy feature Claude Code shipped for a week in April 2026; the crab is ours. Two vendored skills keep their licences next to them (Anthropic's webapp-testing, Apache-2.0; obra's verification-before-completion, MIT). The idea for the tech tree is Age of Empires; the study of a real browser AoE, sokrypton/aoe, is in the docs, ideas only.
