# Vibe Code Camp tasks. Run `just` or `just --list` to see them.
# Python work delegates to uv; orchestration lives here. Install just with
# `brew install just`.
#
# THIS file is the human's: starting the evening, playing, building, testing.
# The imported agents.just adds two groups that render below these in
# `just --list`: [check] (one targeted check per known mistake class) and
# [agent] (compact recipes for coding agents that replace hand-composed
# multi-step shell). Humans can use those too.
