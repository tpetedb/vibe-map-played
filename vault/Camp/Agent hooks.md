# Agent hooks

The same idea inside a coding agent: shell commands (or HTTP endpoints, MCP tools, prompts) that Claude Code runs at points in its lifecycle. PreToolUse can block a tool call, PostToolUse can react to an edit (this repo backs up data/ after every edit), UserPromptSubmit can add context, Stop can keep the agent working, SessionStart can load state. Configured under hooks in settings.json, filtered by a matcher, fed JSON on stdin; exit 2 blocks, JSON on stdout decides.

**History.** Claude Code documents thirty-two hook events, from SessionStart and PreToolUse to PreCompact and WorktreeCreate, in five configuration scopes (user, project, local, managed policy, plugins); the vibe-map repo uses one PostToolUse hook and Tom's toolbox ships guard hooks as a template.

**Try in five minutes.** Open .claude/settings.json in this repo, read the PostToolUse hook, then add a PreToolUse hook with matcher Bash whose command is `jq -e '.tool_input.command | test("rm -rf") | not' >/dev/null || exit 2`. Ask Claude to delete a folder with rm -rf and watch the refusal.
