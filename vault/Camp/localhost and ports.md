# localhost and ports

localhost (127.0.0.1) is your own machine talking to itself over the network stack. A port is a numbered door; a dev server on port 8000 means open http://localhost:8000. Everything web starts here before it goes anywhere.

**History.** Network 127 is set aside for loopback in the Assigned Numbers RFCs (RFC 990, 1986); TCP/IP became the ARPANET standard on 1 January 1983 (RFC 801). Port numbers were assigned by hand by Jon Postel for years, in those same RFCs.

**Try in five minutes.** python3 -m http.server 8000 in the game folder, open http://localhost:8000/game/ in a browser. Ctrl-C to stop.
