# Building and consuming APIs

Consuming: read the docs, get a key, make a request, parse JSON. Building: FastAPI turns a Python function into an endpoint in five lines. Keys are secrets: environment variables, never in git. This is the bridge between your data and every other system.

**History.** SOAP was designed from 1998 and published in 1999; REST-with-JSON replaced it in the 2010s; GraphQL (open sourced 2015) and gRPC (announced 2015, 1.0 in 2016) added alternatives. Today the agent-facing version of an API is an MCP server.

**Try in five minutes.** Ask Claude: 'wrap workspace/sql/per_player.sql in a FastAPI endpoint /players and run it on localhost:8000'. Open the URL.
