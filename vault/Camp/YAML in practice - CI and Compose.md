# YAML in practice: CI and Compose

YAML is data shaped by indentation: a map is key: value, a list is lines starting with a dash, nesting is two spaces. Strings rarely need quotes, which is the trap: no, yes, on and 3:30 can turn into booleans or numbers unless you quote them. One file can hold several documents separated by ---, so a stray separator silently splits your config. CI (GitHub Actions) and Docker Compose chose it because a pipeline is a nested list of steps that people read and diff more often than machines do.

**History.** YAML began in 2001 and the 1.0 spec was published in 2004 by Clark Evans, Oren Ben-Kiki and Ingy dot Net; the 1.2.2 revision (October 2021) clarified the spec without changing it. GitHub Actions became generally available in November 2019 with YAML workflows.

**Try in five minutes.** Read .github/workflows/ci.yml and change the Python version in one place.
