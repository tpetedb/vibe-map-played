# Docker and containers

A container is a packaged process: your code, its dependencies, and a slice of an operating system, running the same on any machine. A Dockerfile is the recipe; an image is the result; a container is a running copy. It ends 'works on my machine'.

**History.** Chroot arrived with Seventh Edition Unix in 1979; Linux mount namespaces in 2002 (kernel 2.4.19) and cgroups in January 2008 (2.6.24). Docker (Solomon Hykes, dotCloud) was first shown at PyCon in March 2013 and made them usable; Kubernetes (Google, open sourced 2014) made them run in fleets. Much of cloud software today runs in containers.

**Try in five minutes.** Install Docker Desktop or OrbStack. docker run -it python:3.12 python -c 'print(1)'. You just ran Python in a box you did not install.
