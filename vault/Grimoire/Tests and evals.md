# Tests and evals

A test runs code and checks the result. An eval does the same for an agent: a set of tasks with known good answers, run after every change to AGENTS.md or a skill. Without tests, an agent will happily make things worse faster.

**History.** JUnit was written by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma on a flight to OOPSLA in 1997, pytest's lineage starts in 2004, property-based testing arrived with QuickCheck (ICFP 2000). Model evals became an engineering discipline around 2023; today teams keep an eval set next to their instruction files.

**Try in five minutes.** Ask Claude: 'write pytest tests for python/scores.py and run them'. Then break scores.py and watch them fail.
