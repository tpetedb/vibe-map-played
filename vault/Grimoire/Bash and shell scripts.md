# Bash and shell scripts

Bash is the language the terminal speaks. A shell script is a text file of commands; pipes (|) chain small tools into big ones. This is also what hooks and setup scripts are written in.

**History.** The Bourne shell shipped with Seventh Edition Unix in January 1979; bash (the Bourne-again shell, written by Brian Fox) went into beta as the GNU replacement in June 1989. macOS switched its default login shell to zsh with macOS 10.15 Catalina in 2019; zsh is bash-compatible for everything you will meet tonight.

**Try in five minutes.** cat data/scores.csv | sort -t, -k3 -n | tail -3 (the three highest scores, no code written).
