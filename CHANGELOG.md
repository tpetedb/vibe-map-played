# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Version 0.2.0 in `pyproject.toml`, not tagged yet.

### Added

- The `grimoire` package: a click CLI (`uv run grimoire`) with status, check, done, map, vault, export, import, scores, council, explain, init, play, start, persona, theme, toolbelt, provider, difficulty, mode and mentor, and rich output in the house palette.
- Quests that verify real work: `grimoire check N` inspects the repo and awards XP, `grimoire done --force` claims at half XP, levels mirror the ages of the tech tree, badges (ADR 0004).
- Versioned pydantic state, migrated on load, and config in `grimoire.toml` with unknown keys refused; personas, themes, a toolbelt report, model providers, the council of mentors, and a Textual onboarding screen (`just start`).
- The vault builder with lint, a committed vault baseline of 96 notes, and the Obsidian vault pre-configured: graph colour groups by tag, a dark base in the house palette, note templates, `docs/VAULT.md`.
- The Python toolchain: a uv project with `pyproject.toml`, a `justfile` with agent recipes, style and link checks in `tools/checks.py` (ADR 0003).
- Browser tests with Playwright: seven Chromium smoke tests and a WebKit iPhone battery (tap, joystick, sheet scroll, HUD width, WebGL draw budget); pytest tests for the CLI (state migration, the progress code version gate, quests, vault build and lint, scores through polars and DuckDB).
- `src/`: the game split into source files with a concatenating build, `tools/build.py --check` to catch hand edits, and `src/data/campaign.json` as the one source for game and CLI (ADR 0001).
- The tech tree fact-checked: every history claim cited to a primary source (137 sources), new nodes for .env, zsh, YAML and TOML, and now Semantic Versioning, changelogs, ADRs and the README.
- Docs: `docs/AOE-STUDY.md` (ADR 0002), `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/ECOSYSTEM.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, `docs/COOKBOOK.md` generated from the personas, `docs/adr/` with four decision records, and this changelog.
- Skills: `council` for agents; `semver`, `changelog`, `adr` and `readme-quickstart` for the documentation habits; vendored `webapp-testing` (Apache-2.0) and `verification-before-completion` (MIT).
- The template pieces: CI and Pages workflows, `env.example`, `scripts/setup.sh` with `--check` and `--yolo`, zsh helpers, `just break`, `just rescue`, `just council`, `just explain`, and a Claude model fallback for print mode.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` adopts the file map, comment and test-loop conventions studied in sokrypton/aoe, ideas only (ADR 0002), and the standard-library-only rule for Python is lifted (ADR 0003).
- The seven house skills rewritten for the `src/` layout and the uv CLI.
- The existing Python formatted with ruff; regenerated outputs stay byte-identical.
- The onboarding test runs on injectable paths instead of the real config.

### Fixed

- Walking on every browser: the collision check called `onLand`, which did not exist (the helper is `onLandW`), so moving Lotte threw a ReferenceError.
- The phone HUD: the name pill takes its own row and the KPIs sit below the buttons.
- The backup hook in `.claude/settings.json`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

The initial package on `main`: the course as one folder, no dependencies beyond Python 3.

### Added

- The single-file 3D game `game/grimoire.html` and the placeholder `game/index.html` for workstream 1.
- `grimoire/cli.py`, a standard-library terminal companion (`python3 grimoire/cli.py status`), with `grimoire/campaign.json`.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOVER.md`, seven house skills in `.agents/skills/`, the `scorekeeper` subagent and the backup hook.
- `data/scores.csv`, three DuckDB queries in `sql/`, and `python/scores.py`.
- The Obsidian vault seed in `vault/Grimoire/`, `README.md`, `docs/SYLLABUS.md`, `docs/RESOURCES.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- The tech tree source `tools/tech.py` with its generator `tools/regen_tree.py`.
