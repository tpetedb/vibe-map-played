## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- The `vibe` package: a click CLI (`uv run vibe`) with status, check, done, map, vault, export, import, scores, council, explain, init, play, start, persona, theme, toolbelt, provider, difficulty, mode and mentor, and rich output in the house palette.
- Quests that verify real work: `vibe check N` inspects the repo and awards XP, `vibe done --force` claims at half XP, levels mirror the ages of the tech tree, badges (ADR 0004).
- Versioned pydantic state, migrated on load, and config in `vibe.toml` with unknown keys refused; personas, themes, a toolbelt report, model providers, the council of mentors, and a Textual onboarding screen (`just start`).
- The vault builder with lint, a committed vault baseline of 96 notes, and the Obsidian vault pre-configured: graph colour groups by tag, a dark base in the house palette, note templates, `docs/VAULT.md`.
- The Python toolchain: a uv project with `pyproject.toml`, a `justfile` with agent recipes, style and link checks in `tools/checks.py` (ADR 0003).
- Browser tests with Playwright: seven Chromium smoke tests and a WebKit iPhone battery (tap, joystick, sheet scroll, HUD width, WebGL draw budget); pytest tests for the CLI (state migration, the progress code version gate, quests, vault build and lint, scores through polars and DuckDB).
- `src/`: the game split into source files with a concatenating build, `tools/build.py --check` to catch hand edits, and `vibemap/data/campaign.json` as the one source for game and CLI (ADR 0001).
- The tech tree fact-checked: every history claim cited to a primary source (137 sources), new nodes for .env, zsh, YAML and TOML, and now Semantic Versioning, changelogs, ADRs and the README.
- Docs: `docs/AOE-STUDY.md` (ADR 0002), `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/ECOSYSTEM.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, `docs/COOKBOOK.md` generated from the personas, `docs/adr/` with four decision records, and this changelog.
- Skills: `council` for agents; `semver`, `changelog`, `adr` and `readme-quickstart` for the documentation habits; vendored `webapp-testing` (Apache-2.0) and `verification-before-completion` (MIT).
- An installable CLI: `uv tool install vibe-map` puts `vibe` on the PATH; it finds the camp from any subfolder (`vibe.toml`, or `VIBE_HOME`), ships the campaign, the tech tree and the resources as package data (`vibemap/data/`, `vibemap/tech.py`), and `vibe new [dir] [--github OWNER/NAME]` clones the template or creates a repo from it.
- Lucide icons (ISC) on the HUD, the enter pill, the sheet, the roadmap rows and the vault toolbar (`src/game/05-icons.js`, `iconize()` for static markup).
- The vault graph runs on d3-force (ISC): a simulation that cools and stops, pan by dragging, zoom with the wheel, labels only on hubs and the selection, an Open in Obsidian button that deep-links to the real vault (`obsidian://open`) or to the vault folder on GitHub when hosted.
- A terminal pet: `vibe pet` (show, animate, configure, gallery), a strolling companion on the launch screen of `just start`, a `[pet]` table in `vibe.toml`. Sprites and the deterministic roll ported from claude-buddy (MIT), plus a crab of our own.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` (three paths in, numbered, with what you should see) and `docs/ABOUT.md` (why it looks like this, whose toolbelt it is); a fourth onboarding screen with the campaign map; the version and theme stamped on the title screen.
- The template pieces: CI and Pages workflows, `env.example`, `scripts/setup.sh` with `--check` and `--yolo`, zsh helpers, `just break`, `just rescue`, `just council`, `just explain`, and a Claude model fallback for print mode.

### Changed

- The product is Vibe Code Camp everywhere: the Python package is `vibemap`, the command is `vibe`, the config is `vibe.toml`, state lives in `.vibe/`, the vault folder is `vault/Camp/`, the game is `game/vibe-map.html`, the skills are `develop-camp`, `install-camp` and `camp-progress`. The game reads progress from the new `vibemap1` key and, once, from the old `grimoire3` key, so nobody loses an evening.
- The title screen: the island renders and orbits behind the panel from the first frame, the brief folds away, a stats row and a monospace kicker replace the wall of text, and the call to action sits above the fold on a phone. Every leftover cyan, violet and pink (callouts, the vault reader, the path rows, the world picker) maps to the five hues; no gradients anywhere.
- The default theme is `studio`: professional, plain, coffee, with Rolinda's questions intact. `wine-night` keeps the original jargon and pairings as an optional mode (`vibe theme wine-night`).
- `AGENTS.md` adopts the file map, comment and test-loop conventions studied in sokrypton/aoe, ideas only (ADR 0002), and the standard-library-only rule for Python is lifted (ADR 0003).
- The seven house skills rewritten for the `src/` layout and the uv CLI.
- The existing Python formatted with ruff; regenerated outputs stay byte-identical.
- The onboarding test runs on injectable paths instead of the real config.

### Removed

- The fantasy layer: the Grimoire codename, the summoned creature with strength and wisdom, the dice, the spell and the dragon. In their place: a project mascot with speed, insight and charm, logged runs, releases and a coffee scoreboard. The satire of corporate language stays.

### Fixed

- Walking on every browser: the collision check called `onLand`, which did not exist (the helper is `onLandW`), so moving Lotte threw a ReferenceError.
- The phone HUD: the name pill takes its own row and the KPIs sit below the buttons.
- The backup hook in `.claude/settings.json`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

The initial package on `main`: the course as one folder, no dependencies beyond Python 3.

### Added

- The single-file 3D game `game/vibe-map.html` and the placeholder `game/index.html` for workstream 1.
- `vibemap/cli.py`, a standard-library terminal companion (`uv run vibe status`), with `vibemap/campaign.json`.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOVER.md`, seven house skills in `.agents/skills/`, the `scorekeeper` subagent and the backup hook.
- `data/scores.csv`, three DuckDB queries in `sql/`, and `python/scores.py`.
- The Obsidian vault seed in `vault/Camp/`, `README.md`, `docs/SYLLABUS.md`, `docs/RESOURCES.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- The tech tree source `tools/tech.py` with its generator `tools/regen_tree.py`.
